# Property Management Website

This is a proof-of-concept project that I created for a family friend who runs a property management company.  The idea is to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
to create a website to showcase properties that the company owns.  HTLM and CSS was used to create the basic layout of the website, while 
Bootstrap was used to help create the home page image carousel as well as the individual property webpages.
